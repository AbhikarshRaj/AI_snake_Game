AI Snake Game
This project leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Q Learning (DQN) to train an AI agent to play the classic Snake game autonomously and achieve high scores. The agent learns by interacting with the game environment and using rewards and penalties to improve its gameplay strategy.

üß† Project Overview
In this project, the AI agent plays the Snake game, where its objective is to consume food items while avoiding collisions with its own body and the game boundaries. Using Deep Q Learning, the agent learns how to make optimal decisions in real-time to maximize its cumulative reward.

Key concepts include:

Reinforcement Learning (RL): The agent learns through trial and error by receiving feedback (rewards or penalties) based on the actions it takes.
Deep Q Learning (DQN): Combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function, enabling the agent to handle complex, high-dimensional state spaces.
This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to dynamic environments like gaming and explores the potential applications of AI in real-world challenges.

üèóÔ∏è Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AbhikarshRaj/AI_snake_game.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd AI_snake_game
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

‚öôÔ∏è Running the Game
To play the Snake game with the AI agent, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python game.py
This will start the game, where the AI agent will attempt to play using the trained model.

To run the game with human controls, execute:

bash
Copy code
python snake_game_human.py
The human-controlled version allows you to play the game manually using the arrow keys.

üìö How It Works
Agent (agent.py): Defines the AI agent that interacts with the game environment. It handles actions, learning, and decision-making based on the Q-values stored in the model.

Game Logic (game.py): Contains the game loop, rendering, and interaction with the agent. It provides the interface between the AI and the Snake game.

Helper Functions (helper.py): Provides utility functions such as state space management, reward calculation, and training data generation.

Model Architecture (model.py): Defines the neural network architecture used for Deep Q Learning. It handles the approximation of Q-values based on the state of the game.

Model Weights (model/model.pth): Stores the trained model weights that the AI agent uses to make decisions.

üí° Training the Model
To train the AI agent from scratch, follow these steps:

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
The agent will start training, playing thousands of games to optimize its strategy. After training, the model weights will be saved in the model/model.pth file.

Note: Training the model can take a significant amount of time depending on the training duration and hardware performance.

üîë Key Features
