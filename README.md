Used AI and ML model to train snake game to play a high scoring game
In recent years, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming has provided a fertile ground for exploring and advancing machine learning techniques. One captivating example is the training of AI agents to play classic video games using reinforcement learning methodologies, with a particular focus on Deep Q Learning (DQN). This project delves into the intriguing domain of training an AI agent to master the Snake game, a deceptively simple yet challenging classic.
The Snake game presents a dynamic environment where an agent, represented as the snake, must navigate a grid to consume food items while avoiding collisions with its own body and the game boundaries. The project's primary goal is to leverage reinforcement learning, specifically the Deep Q Learning approach, to enable the AI agent to autonomously learn optimal strategies for playing the game. Reinforcement learning involves training an agent through trial and error, where it learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Deep Q Learning takes this a step further by utilizing neural networks to approximate the Q-function, allowing the agent to handle complex and high-dimensional state spaces efficiently.
As the AI agent engages in the Snake game, it will iteratively explore various actions, adapting its strategy based on the received feedback. The process involves finding a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation, crucial for the agent to discover effective policies that maximize its cumulative reward over time.
This project not only aims to showcase the capabilities of reinforcement learning and Deep Q Learning in the context of gaming but also explores their potential applications in addressing real-world challenges with unpredictable and dynamic environments. By training an AI agent to navigate and excel in the Snake game, we seek insights into the adaptability and intelligence achievable through these advanced machine learning techniques.
